The authors searched various electronic databases and included 36 studies in their meta-analysis.

The authors applied various inclusion and exclusion criteria to the studies and extracted data on the definition of heatwaves used in each study, the location of the study, and the effect estimate of the association between heatwaves and mortality (e.g., odds ratio, relative risk). They also assessed the quality of the included studies using a standard tool for assessing risk of bias.

The authors used a random-effects model to estimate the pooled effect of heatwaves on mortality across the included studies. They conducted subgroup analyses to investigate the impact of different heatwave definitions on the association between heatwaves and mortality. They also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings to different inclusion criteria and statistical models.

Overall, the study provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between heatwaves and mortality and highlights the importance of considering the definition of heatwaves in assessing their impact on health.

**Lag effects:** This paper used a lag model to evaluate the impact of heatwaves on mortality. They included studies that examined the effects of heatwaves with lags of 0-15 days. 

**Statistical Methods:**
The authors used a random effects model to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) of mortality associated with heatwaves under different heatwave definitions. The RR is a measure of the strength of association between exposure to a particular factor (in this case, heatwaves) and the outcome (in this case, mortality). The authors calculated the RR for each study included in the meta-analysis and then pooled the estimates using the random effects model. The random effects model accounts for both within-study and between-study variability in the estimates of the RR. The authors also performed subgroup analyses to explore the impact of study characteristics on the RR estimates.
