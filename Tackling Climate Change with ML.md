# Abstract

This paper discusses how ML can be used to reduce GHG emissions and help society adapt to changing climate. It flags the proposed solutions into levels of implement-ability based on current technology trends as : 
1. High leverage : bottlenecks that are best suited to be solved by ML
2. Long term : Applications that will have their primary impact after 2040. 
3. Uncertain impact : Impact on GHG emissions is uncertain. 

# Buildings and Cities

Energy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related emissions. [@moraTwentySevenWaysHeat2017], [@moraGlobalRiskDeadly2017] describe the health risks associated with exposure to heat that exceeds human thermoregulatory capacity.
