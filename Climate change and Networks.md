To create the network, they started with temperature data for 3103 weather stations in the contiguous United States. They then applied a threshold-based method to identify heatwaves, where a heatwave was defined as a period of at least three consecutive days where the daily maximum temperature exceeded the 90th percentile of the daily maximum temperature distribution at each station.

Next, they constructed a weighted network by connecting pairs of weather stations that experienced simultaneous heatwaves, and they weighted the edges based on the overlap between the heatwaves. Specifically, the weight of an edge was defined as the number of days that two stations experienced a heatwave at the same time, divided by the length of the longer heatwave.

After constructing the network, they performed various analyses to study the network structure and heatwave propagations. They used the Louvain algorithm to identify communities in the network, and they calculated various network statistics such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality. They also used a PageRank algorithm to identify the most important weather stations in terms of heatwave propagation.
