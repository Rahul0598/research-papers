Climate networks were found to possess "small-world" properties due to long-range connections (geographically distant vertices), that stabilize the climate system and enhance the energy and information transfer within.

The objectives of this study are: (a) to map the topology of synchronization (dynamical similarity), spatial distribution, and propagation of HWs over the Conterminous United States (CONUS), (b) to identify the source and sink regions that control heatwave propagation, and (c) to illustrate the applications of CN metrics to quantify the direction of propagation and prediction of heatwaves.

## Data
The CPC Global Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of daily maximum temperature (T-max) data (Sun et al., 2018) for 1979–2018, provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, USA at a spatial resolution of 0.5° x 0.5° is used in this study. The CPC data have key advantages, such as it displays less bias in representing extreme values compared to the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data set (Behnke et al., 2016), and it has higher station density over CONUS (Sun et al., 2018). Additional variables, such as 1,000 and 500 mb geopotential height, zonal, and meridional wind components were obtained from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 data (Kalnay et al., 1996).

## Method
for each grid-location as a period ($\ge$ 3 consecutive days) when the daily maximum temperature exceeds calendar day 90th percentile during the warm periods of the considered years 1979–2018.
