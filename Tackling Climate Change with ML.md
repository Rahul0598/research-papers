## Abstract

This paper discusses how ML can be used to reduce GHG emissions and help society adapt to changing climate. It flags the proposed solutions into levels of implementability based on current technology trends as : 
1. High leverage : bottlenecks that are best suited to be solved by ML
2. Long term : Applications that will have their primary impact after 2040. 
3. Uncertain impact : Impactt on GHG emissions is uncertain. 

## Buildings and Cities

Energy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related emissions.
