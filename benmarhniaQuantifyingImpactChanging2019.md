Causes of admissions were based on International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal discharge. In this study we used heatstroke and related diagnoses in ICD-9-CM, category 992 as a primary cause of admission. The specific ICD-9-CM codes, located in category 992, that were used to report heat-related signs and symptoms are presented in supplemental material. We then constructed time series of daily counts of heat related illnesses in NYC for the period 2004–2010. It is worth mentioning that focusing on such specific outcome is useful and sensitive as an indicator of the response of extreme heat, but may underestimate the actual burden associated with extreme heat, which can include other outcomes of several other ICD codes (Bobb _et al_ [2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib13), Hopp _et al_ [2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib23)).

We obtained daily (24 h) observations of temperature and dew point measured at the LaGuardia Airport weather station from NOAA (NOAA, 2017) and calculated daily maximum heat index values for NYC using an algorithm developed by the NWS (NWS National Weather Service ([2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib33))).

We also obtained daily (24 h) average levels of PM2.5 and Ozone in NYC that were estimated using population-based monitors in the NYC five counties from the US Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (Bell _et al_ [2015](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib8)). For each county and day, we averaged air pollutants measurements for monitors within that county. We also created categorical variables for calendar year, month, and day of week (weekend versus week days).

To estimate the number of heat-related illnesses that would have occurred if the previous threshold was still in place, the authors developed a statistical model that accounted for temperature, dew point, day of the week, year, and any temporal trends. They then compared the observed number of heat-related illnesses under the new threshold to the expected number under the previous threshold.

The authors also performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of the change in threshold on the number of heat-related illnesses during the heatwave of July 2013, one of the most severe heatwaves in recent history in NYC.

**Lag Effects:** This paper used distributed lag nonlinear models to evaluate the impact of changing the temperature threshold of the New York City heat emergency plan on heat-related illnesses. They included lags of up to 3 days.

**Statistical Methods:**
The authors used a time-series approach to estimate the impact of changing the threshold of the New York City Heat Emergency Plan (HEP) on reducing heat-related illnesses. The authors used daily counts of emergency department visits for heat-related illnesses in New York City during the period 2002-2012. They also obtained data on weather conditions, including temperature and humidity, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). To model the relationship between temperature and heat-related illness, the authors used a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM), which allows for a non-linear relationship between temperature and heat-related illness and accounts for lag effects. The authors then used the model to estimate the number of heat-related illnesses that could be avoided by changing the threshold of the HEP. They also conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of different assumptions and parameter choices on their results.

**Data sources:** The data sources used in this paper included daily weather data, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions for heat-related illnesses in New York City.

**Algorithms used:** The authors used a statistical model to estimate the daily number of heat-related illnesses under different HEP thresholds. They also used Monte Carlo simulations to generate probabilistic estimates of the health impacts of different thresholds.

**How they distinguished between heatwave and non-heatwave days**: This paper used the Heat Index to define heatwave days. They defined a heatwave day as any day when the Heat Index exceeded a certain threshold, such as 80°F or 90°F, for at least two consecutive hours.
