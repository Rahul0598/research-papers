Specifically, the authors use a significance threshold based on a null model that accounts for temporal correlations and spatial autocorrelations in the data.|The resulting network has a total of 188 nodes, each representing a climatic region, and 7,926 edges, each representing a statistically significant correlation between two regions. The network construction algorithm used in the paper is not explicitly stated, but it likely involves thresholding the correlation matrix based on the significance threshold and constructing an adjacency matrix that defines the links between nodes.|

To create the network, they started with temperature data for 3103 weather stations in the contiguous United States. They then applied a threshold-based method to identify heatwaves, where a heatwave was defined as a period of at least three consecutive days where the daily maximum temperature exceeded the 90th percentile of the daily maximum temperature distribution at each station.

Next, they constructed a weighted network by connecting pairs of weather stations that experienced simultaneous heatwaves, and they weighted the edges based on the overlap between the heatwaves. Specifically, the weight of an edge was defined as the number of days that two stations experienced a heatwave at the same time, divided by the length of the longer heatwave.

After constructing the network, they performed various analyses to study the network structure and heatwave propagations. They used the Louvain algorithm to identify communities in the network, and they calculated various network statistics such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality. They also used a PageRank algorithm to identify the most important weather stations in terms of heatwave propagation.

Causes of admissions were based on International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal discharge. In this study we used heatstroke and related diagnoses in ICD-9-CM, category 992 as a primary cause of admission. The specific ICD-9-CM codes, located in category 992, that were used to report heat-related signs and symptoms are presented in supplemental material. We then constructed time series of daily counts of heat related illnesses in NYC for the period 2004–2010. It is worth mentioning that focusing on such specific outcome is useful and sensitive as an indicator of the response of extreme heat, but may underestimate the actual burden associated with extreme heat, which can include other outcomes of several other ICD codes (Bobb _et al_ [2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib13), Hopp _et al_ [2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib23)).

We obtained daily (24 h) observations of temperature and dew point measured at the LaGuardia Airport weather station from NOAA (NOAA, 2017) and calculated daily maximum heat index values for NYC using an algorithm developed by the NWS (NWS National Weather Service ([2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib33))).

We also obtained daily (24 h) average levels of PM2.5 and Ozone in NYC that were estimated using population-based monitors in the NYC five counties from the US Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (Bell _et al_ [2015](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab402e/meta#erlab402ebib8)). For each county and day, we averaged air pollutants measurements for monitors within that county. We also created categorical variables for calendar year, month, and day of week (weekend versus week days).

To estimate the number of heat-related illnesses that would have occurred if the previous threshold was still in place, the authors developed a statistical model that accounted for temperature, dew point, day of the week, year, and any temporal trends. They then compared the observed number of heat-related illnesses under the new threshold to the expected number under the previous threshold.

The authors also performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of the change in threshold on the number of heat-related illnesses during the heatwave of July 2013, one of the most severe heatwaves in recent history in NYC.
