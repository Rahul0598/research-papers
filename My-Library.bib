  abstract = {A major challenge in ecology is forecasting the effects of species' extinctions, a pressing problem given current human impacts on the planet. Consequences of species losses such as secondary extinctions are difficult to forecast because species are not isolated, but interact instead in a complex network of ecological relationships. Because of their mutual dependence, the loss of a single species can cascade in multiple coextinctions. Here we show that an algorithm adapted from the one Google uses to rank web-pages can order species according to their importance for coextinctions, providing the sequence of losses that results in the fastest collapse of the network. Moreover, we use the algorithm to bridge the gap between qualitative (who eats whom) and quantitative (at what rate) descriptions of food webs. We show that our simple algorithm finds the best possible solution for the problem of assigning importance from the perspective of secondary extinctions in all analyzed networks. Our approach relies on network structure, but applies regardless of the specific dynamical model of species' interactions, because it identifies the subset of coextinctions common to all possible models, those that will happen with certainty given the complete loss of prey of a given predator. Results show that previous measures of importance based on the concept of ``hubs'' or number of connections, as well as centrality measures, do not identify the most effective extinction sequence. The proposed algorithm provides a basis for further developments in the analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems.},

To do this, land use changes over the next 20 years (2019\textendash 2040) were predicted from land use changes of the past 29 years (1990\textendash 2019) using the land change modeler (LCM) method. Future climate change was projected for the next 20 years (2020\textendash 2040) based on climate data from 1990 to 2015 using Lars-WG software and two scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Twelve factors that influence flooding and 262 lo\- cations of past floods were used to model the spatial pattern of flood susceptibility in the watershed. A random forest (RF) model and a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLMbayes) were used to predict areas susceptible to flooding. The results showed that elevation (21.55), distance from river (15.28), land use (11.1), slope (10.58), and rainfall (6.8) are the most important factors affecting flooding in this basin. The factors were modified according to land use changes and climate changes and the models were revised. The land use and climate forecasting in this region indicate that land use change, like decreased forest cover (- 77.19 km2) and reduced rangeland (- 218.83 km2) near rivers and downstream, can be expected and rainfall is projected to increase (under from both scenarios). These changes would result in increased probabilities of flooding in the downstream portion of the watershed and near the sea. The area-under-the-curve evaluation of the models indicates that the RF model more accurately predicted flood probability (0.91) than did the GLMbayes model (0.847).},

  abstract = {The friendship paradox states that in a social network, egos tend to have lower degree than their alters, or, ``your friends have more friends than you do''. Most research has focused on the friendship paradox and its implications for information transmission, but treating the network as static and unweighted. Yet, people can dedicate only a finite fraction of their attention budget to each social interaction: a highdegree individual may have less time to dedicate to individual social links, forcing them to modulate the quantities of contact made to their different social ties. Here we study the friendship paradox in the context of differing contact volumes between egos and alters, finding a connection between contact volume and the strength of the friendship paradox. The most frequently contacted alters exhibit a less pronounced friendship paradox compared with the ego, whereas less-frequently contacted alters are more likely to be high degree and give rise to the paradox. We argue therefore for a more nuanced version of the friendship paradox: ``your closest friends have slightly more friends than you do'', and in certain networks even: ``your best friend has no more friends than you do''. We demonstrate that this relationship is robust, holding in both a social media and a mobile phone dataset. These results have implications for information transfer and influence in social networks, which we explore using a simple dynamical model.},

  abstract = {Background This review examines recent evidence on mortality from elevated ambient temperature for studies published from January 2001 to December 2008. Methods PubMed was used to search for the following keywords: temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality. The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies. Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations. Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded. Results Thirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association. The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations. Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld. Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children. Conclusion Many of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study population. Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas, are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.},

We show that it is possible to predict the height of buildings from 2D data (their footprints and attributes available in volunteered geoinformation and cadastre), and then extrude their footprints to obtain 3D models suitable for a multitude of applications. The predictions have been carried out with machine learning techniques (random forests) using 10 different attributes and their combinations, which mirror different scenarios of completeness of real-world data. Some of the scenarios resulted in surprisingly good performance (given the circumstances): we have achieved a mean absolute error of 0.8m in the inferred heights, which satisfies the accuracy recommendations of CityGML for LOD1 models and the needs of several GIS analyses. We show that our method can be used in practice to generate 3D city models where there are no elevation data, and to supplement existing datasets with 3D models of newly constructed buildings to facilitate rapid update and maintenance of data.},

Given a set of images of a scene, semantic 3D reconstruction aims to densely reconstruct both the 3D shape of the scene and a segmentation into semantic object classes. Jointly reasoning about shape and class allows one to take into account class-specific shape priors (e.g., building walls should be smooth and vertical, and vice versa smooth, vertical surfaces are likely to be building walls), leading to improved reconstruction results. So far, semantic 3D reconstruction methods have been limited to small scenes and low resolution, because of their large memory footprint and computational cost. To scale them up to large scenes, we propose a hierarchical scheme which refines the reconstruction only in regions that are likely to contain a surface, exploiting the fact that both high spatial resolution and high numerical precision are only required in those regions. Our scheme amounts to solving a sequence of convex optimizations while progressively removing constraints, in such a way that the energy, in each iteration, is the tightest possible approximation of the underlying energy at full resolution. In our experiments the method saves up to 98\% memory and 95\% computation time, without any loss of accuracy.},

The information on the building type (detached building, terraced building, etc.) is essential for a variety of relevant applications of 3D city models like spatial marketing, real estate management and marketing, and for visualization. The derivation of the building type from coarse data (mainly 2D footprints, building heights and functions) seems impossible at first sight. However it succeeds by incorporating the spatial context of a building. Since the input data can be derived easily and at very low cost, this method is widely applicable. Nevertheless, as with all supervised learning algorithms, obtaining labelled training data is very time-consuming. Herewith, we provide a method which uses outlier detection and clustering methods to support users in efficiently and rapidly obtaining adequate training data.},

Our model is based upon a data set of monthly electricity and gas bills, collected by a utility over the course of several years, for approximately 6,500 buildings in Cambridge, MA.  In addition, we use publicly available tax assessor records and geographical survey information to determine corresponding features for the buildings.  Using both parametric and non-parametric learning methods, we learn models that predict distributions over energy usage based upon these features, and use these models to develop two end-user systems.  For utilities or authorized institutions (those who may obtain access to the full data) we provide a system that visualizes energy consumption for each building in the city; this allows companies to quickly identify outliers (buildings which use much more energy than expected even after conditioning on the relevant predictors), for instance allowing them to target homes for potential retrofits or tiered pricing schemes.  For other end users, we provide an interface for entering their own electricity and gas usage, along with basic information about their home, to determine how their consumption compares to that of similar buildings as predicted by our model.  Merely allowing users to contextualize their consumption in this way, relating it to the consumption in similar buildings, can itself produce behavior changes to significantly reduce consumption.},

  abstract = {Different layouts can characterize different aspects of the same graph. Finding a "good" layout of a graph is thus an important task for graph visualization. In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.},

People, however, rarely have global knowledge of the states of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their social contacts. Network structure can significantly distort individual's local observations. Under some conditions, a state that is globally rare in a network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many individuals. This effect, which we call the ``majority illusion,'' leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of that state, which may accelerate the spread of social contagions. We develop a statistical model that quantifies this effect and validate it with measurements in synthetic and real-world networks. We show that the illusion is exacerbated in networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and disassortative structure.},

Due to support vector regression has good performance in dealing with non-linear data regression problem, in recent years it often was used to predict building energy consumption.

To develop accurate prediction model of lighting energy consumption, the support vector regression with radial basis function was applied. The forecast results indicate that the prediction accuracy of support vector regression is higher than neural networks. The prediction model can forecast the building hourly energy consumption and assess the impact of office building energy management plans.},

In this study, an investigation was performed to classify buildings delineated from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data into three types: single-family houses, multiple-family houses, and non-residential buildings. Four kinds of spatial attributes describing the shape, location, and surrounding environment of buildings were calculated and subsequently employed in the classification. Experiments were performed in suburban and downtown sites in Denver, CO, USA, considering different building components and neighborhood environments. Building type classification results yielded overall accuracy{$>$}70\% and Kappa{$>$}0.5 for both sites, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining building type information from LiDAR data. The shape attributes, such as width, footprint area, and perimeter, were most useful for identifying building types. Environmental landscape attributes surrounding buildings, such as the number of road and parking lot pixels, also contributed to obtaining building type information. Combining shape and environmental landscape attributes was necessary to obtain accurate and consistent classification results.},

Existing, peer-reviewed published literature on heat effects on human health as well as heat-health indicators was reviewed. Interviews and structured observations to collect data on heat effects on human health in Agincourt sub-district were conducted. The Lancet Countdown heat-related indicators were applied as a framework against which to discuss our findings. A total of 93 participants who lived in Agincourt sub-district for 5 years and more were interviewed. Participants reported that temperatures, especially summertime temperatures, had been rising over the past years. Health effects of heat were deemed more apparent in relation to morbidity. Heatwaves were not easily comprehensible as singular `events', and their effects were poorly understood. The population groups disproportionately affected by heat included infants, the elderly, those living with disability and outdoor workers. High ambient temperatures were deemed to be associated with reduced labour productivity of outdoor workers. Community-level perceptions of heat impacts on health were mainly related to illnesses and diseases, with no understanding of mortality risk. Future health awareness campaigns that encompass the full range of heat-health impacts are essential to reduce vulnerability, morbidity, and mortality. Our study provided location-specific, qualitative, and indicator-aligned data for a geographic area expected to undergo significant heat stress in the future. The study findings have significant research, policy, and practice implications in similar resource-limited settings.},

We analyze changes in summer temperatures, the frequency, severity, and duration of heat waves, and heat-related mortality in India between 1960 and 2009 using data from the India Meteorological Department. Mean temperatures across India have risen by more than 0.5\textdegree C over this period, with statistically significant increases in heat waves. Using a novel probabilistic model, we further show that the increase in summer mean temperatures in India over this period corresponds to a 146\% increase in the probability of heat-related mortality events of more than 100 people. In turn, our results suggest that future climate warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality, particularly in developing low-latitude countries, such as India, where heat waves will become more frequent and populations are especially vulnerable to these extreme temperatures. Our findings indicate that even moderate increases in mean temperatures may cause great increases in heat-related mortality and support the efforts of governments and international organizations to build up the resilience of these vulnerable regions to more severe heat waves.},

  abstract = {Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between hot weather conditions and hospital admissions due to work-related accidents in Tuscany (central Italy) over the period 1998\textendash 2003. Apparent temperature (AT) values were calculated to evaluate human weather discomfort due to hot conditions and then tested for work accident differences using non-parametric procedures. Present findings showed that hot weather conditions might represent a risk factor for work-related accidents in Italy during summer. In particular early warming days during June, characterized by heat discomfort, are less tolerated by workers than warming days of the following summer months. The peak of work-related accidents occurred on days characterized by high, but not extreme, thermal conditions. Workers maybe change their behaviour when heat stress increases, reducing risks by adopting preventive measures. Results suggested that days with an average daytime AT value ranged between 24.8\textdegree C and 27.5\textdegree C were at the highest risk of work-related accidents. In conclusion, present findings might represent the first step for the development of a watch/warning system for workers that might be used by employers for planning work activities.},

This study seeks to examine the influence of these theoretical frameworks on the formulation of adaptation initiatives with a sample of 45 coastal cities in developing countries. The vulnerability framework is found to tackle the issues of climate change sufficiently while the hazard-based approach shares resources for both climate change and other matters, and the urban resilience framework puts more effort into other issues rather than climate change. From these findings, the study offers implications for adaptation planning in applying each of these three frameworks.},

These local metrics are aggregated, and global metrics are proposed to express the phenomenon on a network-wide level. Theoretical results show that the defined metrics are well-behaved enough to capture the friendship paradox. We also theoretically analyze the behavior of the friendship paradox for popular network models in order to understand regimes where friendship paradox occurs. These theoretical findings are complemented by experimental results on both network models and real-world networks. By conducting a correlation study between the proposed metrics and degree assortativity, we experimentally demonstrate that the phenomenon of the friendship paradox is related to the well-known phenomenon of assortative mixing.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many cities have adopted energy disclosure policies to better understand how energy is consumed in the urban built environment and how energy use and carbon emissions can be reduced. The diffusion of such policies has generated large-scale streams of building energy data, creating new opportunities to develop the fundamental science of urban energy dynamics. Nevertheless, there is limited research that rigorously analyzes building energy performance patterns over time. This paper provides a comprehensive framework to analyze building energy time series data and identify buildings with similar temporal energy performance patterns. We use data from approximately 15,000 properties in New York City, covering a six-year reporting period from 2011 to 2016. After pre-processing and merging the data for each constituent year, we use an unsupervised learning algorithm to optimally cluster the energy time series and statistical tests and supervised learning methods to infer how building characteristics vary between clusters. Our results show that energy reductions in New York City are mainly driven by its commercial building stock, with larger, newer, and highervalue buildings demonstrating the largest improvements in energy intensity over the study period. Moreover, voluntary energy conservation schemes are found to be more effective in boosting energy performance of commercial properties, compared to residential buildings. Our results suggest two distinct temporal patterns of energy performance for commercial and residential buildings, characterized by energy use reductions and increases. This finding highlights the differential response to energy reporting and disclosure, and presents a more complex picture of energy use dynamics over time when compared to previous studies. In order to realize significant energy use improvements over time and reach energy and carbon reduction goals, cities need to design and implement comprehensive energy policy frameworks, bringing together information transparency and reporting with targeted mandates and incentives.},

Applications of hyperspectral remote sensing techniques for the detection of CH4 in the near and shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR: 0.75\textendash 3 \textmu m) and longwave infrared (LWIR: 7\textendash 14 \textmu m) have been demonstrated in the literature with multiple sensors and scenarios. However, the acquisition and processing of hyperspectral data in the midwave infrared (MWIR: 3\textendash 5 \textmu m) for this application is rather scarce. Here, a controlled field experiment was used to evaluate the potential for CH4 plume detection in the MWIR based on hyperspectral data acquired with the SEBASS airborne sensor. For comparison purposes, LWIR data were also acquired simultaneously with the same instrument. The experiment included surface and undersurface emission sources (ground stations), with flow rates ranging between 0.6\textendash 40 m3/h. The data collected in both ranges were sequentially processed using the same methodology. The CH4 plume was detected, variably, in both datasets. The gas plume was detected in all LWIR images acquired over nine gas leakage stations. In the MWIR range, the plume was detected in only four stations, wherein 18 m3/h was the lowest flux sensed. We demonstrate that the interference of target reflectance, the low contrast between plume and background and a low signal of the CH4 feature in the MWIR at ambient conditions possibly explain the inferior results observed for this range when compared to LWIR. Furthermore, we show that the acquisition time and weather conditions, including specific limits of temperature, humidity, and wind speed, proved critical for plume detection using daytime MWIR hyperspectral data.},

We used place of residence reported in mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System from 2005 to 2014 as a proxy for citizenship to examine differences in heat-related deaths between non-US and US citizens. Estimates from the US Census Bureau American Community Survey of self-reported citizenship status and place of birth provided the numbers for the study population. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio and relative risk for heat-related deaths between non-US and US citizens nationally. Results. Heat-related deaths accounted for 2.23\% (n\,=\,999) of deaths among non-US citizens and 0.02\% (n\,=\,4196) of deaths among US citizens. The age-adjusted standardized mortality ratio for non-US citizens compared with US citizens was 3.4 (95\% confidence ratio [CI]\,=\,3.2, 3.6). This risk was higher for Hispanic non-US citizens (risk ratio [RR]\,=\,3.6; 95\% CI\,=\,3.2, 3.9) and non-US citizens aged 18 to 24 years (RR\,=\,20.6; 95\% CI\,=\,16.5, 25.7). Conclusions. We found an increased mortality risk among non-US citizens compared with US citizens for heat-related deaths, especially those younger and of Hispanic ethnicity.},

While it is clear that the event was extreme, it is not obvious whether other areas in the world have also experienced events so far outside their natural variability. Using a novel assessment of heat extremes, we investigate how extreme this event was in the global context. Characterizing the relative intensity of an event as the number of standard deviations from the mean, the western North America heat wave is remarkable, coming in at over four standard deviations. Throughout the globe, where we have reliable data, only five other heat waves were found to be more extreme since 1960. We find that in both reanalyses and climate projections, the statistical distribution of extremes increases through time, in line with the distribution mean shift due to climate change. Regions that, by chance, have not had a recent extreme heat wave may be less prepared for potentially imminent events.},

We compute numerous features of the graph including the number of users and friendships, the degree distribution, path lengths, clustering, and mixing patterns. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the graph, determining that the social network is nearly fully connected, with 99.91\% of individuals belonging to a single large connected component, and we confirm the `six degrees of separation' phenomenon on a global scale. Second, by studying the average local clustering coefficient and degeneracy of graph neighborhoods, we show that while the Facebook graph as a whole is clearly sparse, the graph neighborhoods of users contain surprisingly dense structure. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns present in the graph by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity and characterize the extent to which `your friends have more friends than you'. Furthermore, we observe a strong effect of age on friendship preferences as well as a globally modular community structure driven by nationality, but we do not find any strong gender homophily. We compare our results with those from smaller social networks and find mostly, but not entirely, agreement on common structural network characteristics.},

For each heat wave event, we selected a control period in the same season that was twice as long. Scheduling a visit on a heat wave day (versus a non-heat wave day) was the primary predictor, and receiving a primary ICD-9 disease code related to heat waves was the outcome. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity and marital status.Of the 5448 visits across the heat wave and control periods, 6.4\% of visits (n = 346) were for heat wave-related diagnoses. Scheduling a visit on heat wave day was not associated with receiving a heat wave-related ICD code as compared with the control period (adjusted odds ratio: 1.35; 95\% confidence interval: 0.86\textendash 1.36; P = 0.51).We show that in a relatively large and demographically diverse population, patients who schedule appointments during heat waves are not being more frequently seen for diagnoses typically associated with heat waves in the acute setting. Given that heat waves are increasing in frequency due to climate change, there is an opportunity to increase utilization of primary care clinics during heat waves.},

All published epidemiological studies in the field of health impacts of workplace heat exposure for the period of January 1997 to April 2012 were reviewed. Finally, 55 original articles were identified. Manual workers who are exposed to extreme heat or work in hot environments may be at risk of heat stress, especially those in low-middle income countries in tropical regions. At risk workers include farmers, construction workers, fire-fighters, miners, soldiers, and manufacturing workers working around process-generated heat. The potential impacts of workplace heat exposure are to some extent underestimated due to the underreporting of heat illnesses. More studies are needed to quantify the extent to which high-risk manual workers are physiologically and psychologically affected by or behaviourally adapt to workplace heat exposure exacerbated by climate change.},

However, no universally consistent heatwave definition is available. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the heatwave definitions used in the literature published up to 1st April 2015 by searching five databases (PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science). Random-effects models were used to pool the effects of heatwave on total and cardiorespiratory mortality by different heatwave definitions. Existing evidence suggests a significant impact of heatwave on mortality, but the magnitude of the effect estimates varies under different heatwave definitions. Heatwave-related mortality risks increased by 4\% (using ``mean temperatures {$\geq$}95th percentile for {$\geq$}2days'' as a heatwave definition), 3\% (mean temperatures {$\geq$}98th percentile for {$\geq$}2days), 7\% (mean temperatures {$\geq$}99th percentile for {$\geq$}2days) and 16\% (mean temperatures {$\geq$}97th percentile for {$\geq$}5days). Heatwave intensity plays a relatively more important role than duration in determining heatwave-related deaths. Heatwaves significantly increase mortality across the globe, but the effect estimates vary with the definition of heatwaves. City- or region-specific heat health early warning systems based on identified local heatwave definitions may be optimal for protecting and preventing people from the adverse impacts of future heatwaves.},

Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.},
