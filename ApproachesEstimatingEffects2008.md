The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with estimating the effects of climate change on heat-related deaths. It provides an overview of the current state of knowledge, identifies key research gaps, and proposes a research agenda to improve understanding of this important issue. The authors argue that there is a need for more detailed and accurate data on heat-related deaths and the risk factors associated with them, as well as a better understanding of the complex interplay between climate, vulnerability, and adaptation. They also highlight the importance of developing better models and analytical methods to assess the effects of climate change on heat-related mortality.

**Statistical methods:** The paper discusses various statistical methods that have been used to estimate the effects of climate change on heat-related mortality, including time-series regression models, case-crossover designs, and distributed lag models. The authors also highlight the challenges associated with these methods, such as confounding, exposure measurement error, and model misspecification

1. Time-series regression: This is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and time. In the context of the papers, time-series regression was used to model the relationship between daily mortality and temperature or heatwaves.
2.  Generalized linear models (GLMs): GLMs are a class of models that can be used to model a wide range of dependent variables, including binary outcomes (e.g., mortality) and counts. In the context of the papers, GLMs were used to model the relationship between mortality and temperature or heatwaves.
3.  Distributed lag models (DLMs): DLMs are a type of time-series regression model that can account for delayed effects of an exposure on an outcome. In the context of the papers, DLMs were used to model the lagged effects of heatwaves on mortality.
4.  Meta-analysis: This is a statistical method that combines the results of multiple studies to estimate an overall effect. In the context of the papers, meta-analysis was used to estimate the overall effect of heatwaves on mortality across multiple studies.
5.  Spatial analysis: This is a statistical method that models the relationship between a variable and geographic location. In the context of the papers, spatial analysis was used to examine the spatial distribution of heatwave-related mortality.
6.  Quantile regression: This is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables across different quantiles of the distribution of the dependent variable. In the context of the papers, quantile regression was used to model the relationship between temperature or heatwaves and mortality across different quantiles of the mortality distribution.

**Data sources:** The paper reviews a range of studies that have examined the relationship between climate change and heat-related mortality, using data from a variety of sources including vital statistics, hospital records, and weather stations. The authors also discuss the limitations of these data sources, such as incomplete coverage, inconsistent data quality, and lack of information on confounding factors.
